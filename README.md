# Front End Technical Test for Colider

A simple responsive 1 pager with 3 sections, including a hero slider and paginating content boxes.

HTML5 Boiler plate was used as a template.

The hero slider uses Owl Carousel

Pajinate was used for the content boxes pagination.

Code written by myself can be found in the index.html, main.css and js/main.js directories.
